# 🌸 Sana Khatib
**PhD Student · Systems Biology · Weizmann Institute of Science**

Hi there! I’m a biochemist studying how **transcription factors** and  
**intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs)** shape gene regulation.  
I combine **biochemistry**, **quantitative biology**, and a bit of **creativity** to uncover how complexity emerges in living systems.
